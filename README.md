# React + Vite + Bootstrap as frontend
React has been dealing with some issues regarding the instalation so i used Vite as the handler.

For installing it you need: `npm create vite@latest` if you want to create a new one.

Then you get into the folder and run `npm install` to install all the packages.

If you will just use mine, then just run an `npm install` and all the packages will run ok.

For execution just type `npm run dev`

You will need to update the VITE_BACKEND_URL so that is the right one.
